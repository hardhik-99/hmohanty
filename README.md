Hey sup, I am a researcher in blockchain and decentralised finance at University of Southern California, Los Angeles. As you might have guessed from the location, frequent beach trips and drives along the Pacific coast are my thing. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering along with Master's in Financial Engineering from USC (finance is like my side hustle!). It also helps my DeFi research so..
Prior to this, I worked as a mitacs globalink research intern at York University, Toronto. Here i explored topics like deep learning algorithms for darknet characterization and behavioral profiling of malware attacks. Overall, I had a fantastic hands-on experience with several network security projects and also improved my computational and systems skills!! 

My bachelor's and master's degree is from IIT Kharagpur, India. I majored in Electrical Engineering with a specialisation in ML, AI and its applications. I somehow (barely!) made it through the core circuity stuff but EE helped build my engineering mathematical foundation. I graduated with a 9.01 cgpa (phew!) out of 10 and department rank-2. During my undergrad research days, I explored reinforcement learning and bandit algorithms in non-stationary environment. Plus I peeked in the world of federated learning through my bachelor's thesis. Prolly the reason I looked further onto distributed computing and got hooked to blockchain. Also now integrating DeFi to my expertise!! (blame my try-out-new-things to stay happy mindset) 

I am a budding expert in my research field constantly gaining delta knowledge everyday. Also, creating new niche areas for fellow researchers to get baffled on. Look below for more details on my interests and work! I love collaborations and networking with people academically!! Do reach out through my contacts for a discussion.
